Download the .m files and keep them both in a single folder to run Matlab codes for ACC. Then just run cruisecontrol.m file to get desired outcome.
Download the .slx file and .mat file and keep them in a single folder to run ACC using Simulink. This is the simulink model for the same ACC for which the code is done.

In either case, input parameters need to be selected at first to get proper output.
These files can be opened by using Matlab R2023b or updated versions.
